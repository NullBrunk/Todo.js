# 📚 General overview

To gain more experience with React and the localStorage API, I developed a dynamic to-do app with various features such as a search bar, a checkbox to hide completed tasks, and more. Tasks are stored in localStorage, ensuring that all modifications are persisted. Finally, the frontend is built using Tailwind.

# ⚒️ Installation
